11)Using sigprocmask(), sigismember() and sigfillset() functions implement a function that lists all
signals blocked when a process receives the SIGUSR1 signal. 
a)Are all signals blocked? Justify your answer
by mentioning those which are not eventually blocked.

The implementation blocks all signals except for SIGUSR1,because we deleted for not to be blocked,
it cannot block or catch critical signals such as SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, and SIGCONT.
