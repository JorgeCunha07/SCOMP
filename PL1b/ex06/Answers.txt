Recall the meaning of global variables and static variables. Is it safe to use global or static variables
inside a signal handler? Justify your answer.

It is generally not safe to use global or static variables inside a signal handler in C because signal handlers run asynchronously.
When a signal handler is executed, the state of the program is not guaranteed to be consistent.
Example:
If a signal is raised while a global variable is being modified, the signal handler may be executed before the modification is complete.

To avoid these issues, it is recommended to use only local variables inside signal handlers.
