PSEUDOCODE

Define the functions:
    - buy_chips(): Prints "Buying chips!"
    - buy_beer(): Prints "Buying beer!"
    - eat_and_drink(): Prints "Eating and drinking!"

Initialize variables and resources:
    - Declare sem_t variable: sem
    - Declare pid_t variable: p
    - Declare int variable: sval

Generate a random number:
    - Set random as rand() % 6

Create the semaphore:
    - Call sem_open("semaforo", O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR, 0)
        - If sem_open fails, print error message and exit

Create child processes:
    - For i from 0 to CHILD_PROCESSES:
        - Set p as fork()
        - If p is -1, print error message and exit

        If in the child process:
            - Generate a random number r
            - Sleep for r seconds
            - Decide whether to execute buy_chips() or buy_beer() based on the value of r
            - Increment the semaphore (sem_post)

            - Repeat the following loop until the semaphore value is 6:
                - Get the current value of the semaphore (sem_getvalue)
                - If sem_getvalue fails, print error message and exit

            - Execute the function eat_and_drink()
            - Exit the child process

Wait for all child processes to finish:
    - For j from 0 to CHILD_PROCESSES:
        - Call wait(NULL) to wait for a child process to finish

Return 0 to indicate successful execution


PATTERN

In this case, the waiting mechanism used in the code can be considered as passive waiting.
Passive waiting refers to a situation where a process blocks or goes to sleep until a certain condition is met. 
In the code, the parent process passively waits for the child processes to increment the semaphore sem using sem_post(sem).
