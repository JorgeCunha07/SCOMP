PSEUDOCODE

Define main function:
    Declare sem as a pointer to sem_t structure
    Declare pid as a pid_t

    Create a semaphore using sem_open:
        Use "sem" as the name of the semaphore
        Use O_CREAT flag to create the semaphore if it doesn't exist
        Set permissions for the semaphore using 0644
        Store the semaphore pointer returned by sem_open in sem
        If sem_open returns SEM_FAILED, print an error message and exit the program

    Fork a child process and store the returned process ID in pid

    If pid equals 0 (child process):
        Print "1st child!"
        Release the semaphore using sem_post
        Exit the child process

    Wait on the semaphore using sem_wait in the parent process
    Wait for the child process to complete using wait(NULL)
    Print "Father!"

    Fork another child process and store the returned process ID in pid

    If pid equals 0 (child process):
        Print "2nd child!"
        Release the semaphore using sem_post
        Exit the child process

    Wait on the semaphore using sem_wait in the parent process
    Wait for the child process to complete using wait(NULL)

    Unlink the semaphore using sem_unlink:
        Pass "sem" as the name of the semaphore to sem_unlink
        If sem_unlink returns a negative value, exit the program

    Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program


PATTERN 

Since the parent process in the code 
repeatedly checks the semaphore
 without yielding the CPU to other processes, 
 it can be considered an example of active waiting.
